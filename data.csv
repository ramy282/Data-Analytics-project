The materials arrived early and were in excellent condition.  However for the money spent they really should've come with a binder and not just loose leaf.
"I am really enjoying this book with the worksheets that make you review your goals, what to do when you do not make it, it reminds me  of my human sexuality classwork."
"IF YOU ARE TAKING THIS CLASS DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS SO CALLED BOOK! $140.00 FOR A ""BOOK"" THAT ISIN'T EVEN BOUND LOOSE LEAFS, THAT I HAD TO PROVIDE MY OWN BINDER FOR. TURNS OUT YOU CAN BUY ACCESS TO THE BOOK AT MCGRAW HILL CONNECT CORE FOR $70.00

THIS BOOK IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!"
This book was missing pages!!! Important pages. I couldn't answer some test questions because of it!! I have never had this happen before.
"I have used LearnSmart and can officially say that this is an amazing study tool that quickly and simply adapts to your style of learning. You can access it at anytime and it is on the go! Once you start using LearnSmart you will quickly realize that this is the best way to learn and study.

I am a business student and I did not use LearnSmart for my Accounting I class, however, I did use it for my Accounting II class. The grade difference from Accounting I to Accounting II was a whole letter grade... thanks to LearnSmart!

Every college student should definitely check it out!"
This was the textbook that I used for my E-Commerce course. I was able to understand it and to stay focused while I read it.
Not worth the price. Most of the concepts are pretty superficial. The authors are also a little behind on the times.
"This book served as the textbook for the first of a 3-course series on internet marketing for my MBA course.  While it was acceptable as a textbook - a broad survey of E-commerce for academic use - it would not be worth the considerable cost for someone who did not need it for a course.

For an academic course, the book serves as a base by providing definitions and explanations for a broad range of topics.  In my course, the book was used to introduce a number of topics that were discussed in further detail during class discussions, and it was supplemented by case studies, videos, and articles with more depth.  A non-academic reader would not have those enrichment elements available, thus would likely find the book less useful.

The book does not explain how to do anything (set up an online store, write a blog article, configure analytics, etc.).  It is a decent text for someone looking for a broad view of e-commerce with emphasis on defining terms and covering the big picture.

I do not recommend this book for anything other than a required course text."
"I love how this book is structurated and the fact that it contains details graphics so the newbie cannot be lost at any minute.

Also, it has a pretty amazing list of sites and webmaster tools, which makes this book ""a must"" on everybodys Internet marketers shelf :)"
"Great on the delivery...doing my assignments as I write.  The shipping charge was a little pricy, but the book was in great condition (and did not smell like smoke...as other books I had purchased).  Thank you."
The book was delivered faster then I had been told and was in great condition. This book is a required text for my college class and is well written.
"Required to buy this book for Marketing 3721 class and we rarely used it. Even when we did, I felt the text was out dated and not very informational."
"The title of this DVD is Introduction to Adobe Premiere Elements 11, and that is exactly what this is - a short introduction.  Maybe if you nare already an experienced operator of some older version of then program, It will familiarize you with the idiosynchrases of a newer version, but teach you the basics of movie-making and this program, nope!  You need something much more basic than this.  But you usually get what you pay for!"
"I purchased Premier Elements 11 and its difficult well impossible to use. I am proficient Adobe Photoshop user all the way back to Photoshop 7
I am new to video, this DVD-ROM is nice, and handy I just wish it was DVD split up in chapters so I can use it in my DVD player while I am working on my computer.
Im still using it as a reference when I need to perform some unusual task.
This DVD-ROM is a must with Premier Elements 11."
"Having no experience with Adobe Premiere Elements the ""Learn by Video"" answered a lot of my questions and got me off to a good start using the video editing program.  I would definitely recommended it."
"Adobe Premiere Elements 11 is difficult for a first-time user. Reading through the manual did not give me the push I needed to start editing my own footage. But Chad Perkins, the voice on this Learn by Video CD, gave me the knowledge and the motivation I needed to start experimenting with some of my own footage on the Timeline. His examples and explanations clarified what for me were difficult problems.

Experienced film editors will probably not need this video; people new to film editing and the Adobe program will greatly benefit from it though. The actual creation of short, coherent movies from multiple clips in the video is a teaching technique that registers: I picked up some difficult concepts quickly because of this.

Chad Perkins the host is intelligent and personable. His knowledge and subtle sense of humor made the many hours of teaching fly by fast. However, one viewing will not be enough. I'm on my third viewing now (perhaps I'm a slow learner) and I might need a few more. Chad's instruction sinks in better I think if a person is working on a real project. A real project plus Chad's insights are a good combination for mastering Premiere Elements."
"I bought Adobe Premier Elements 11 because I wanted to learn how to edit the footage that I was able to get out of my new Canon rebel T3I. I figured that because I was a whiz at Microsoft office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, etc.) that I could just turn it on and it would be easy to pick it up. What I learned was that just because you're a whiz at 1 kind of software made by 1 company doesn't mean anything when you go to software made by another company. I could not get past just turning it on. Everything was so different. I got worried and figured that I needed help to learn this. I didn't want to spend some more money but if I didn't the software that I had already bought was going to be worthless to me.

I sure am glad that I chose to get this. In the first 30 seconds of the DVD I learned an easier way to add media (video, audio, pictures) than what I had learned in studying Adobe's website for an hour. After watching it all, it seems so simple now. The narrator does move very quickly through the functions and how to work them so the pause button on my DVD player got a real workout. With the DVD paused I was able to try out some of his tips on my computer while I watched it. This was so helpful!

I recommend this to anyone who is new to editing video. This really helped me understand how easy it is to work the software and also just how much the software will do. By the end of the DVD I had learned things that I didn't even know that it could do. Just remember that he goes quickly and if you want to try it out on the computer along with watching the DVD that you will have to become a pro at pausing the DVD player.

Now that I know how to work Premier Elements to its full potential, Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese better watch out. I will soon be turning out better video than anyone in Hollywood! I know that a video review would be more logical for this, but I don't have a minute to spare. I am anxious to get started making incredible video."
gets to the mechanics of the the software very succinctly.  It is augmented well by the book 100 (actually more--another 5 star) tips on Elements .
"Using this to teach me how to use premiere elements 11, made me realized just how easy it is to use, I recommend this to anyone, you won't be sorry."
Very easy product to use. It's clear. Concise. Works the brain properly.
"I love the Human Japanese software. I had a little trouble downloading it, so I wrote the author and he responded quickly. The program is easy to follow and I can click on words to hear the pronunciations. I also purchased Japanese Hiragana & Katakana for beginners and it goes really well with this program. (I test myself with the free multiple choice Kana quizzes on easyJapanese.org, but I've made flash cards too). After I learn all the Hiragana & Katakana I think I'll be able to progress faster in the program, but it's been great so far."
"only problem, daughter lost a code and ow cannot access the info on the computer. frustrating"
"For an intro to learning Japanese, I found it very understandable. I have not fully completed reading yet, but I can say that I am satisfied with the overall presentation of it. I should also note that I spent weeks looking for something to get my foundation started on learning Japanese.

The only issue I had is that I am wishing there was an audio version, or someway to put it on my tablet/phone, so I don't have to sit in front of the computer."
There is a lot of great information in here but I feel like I'm just reading an interactive textbook.
This really helps and is easy to use to help you understand the language more clearly!
"Good program. A few little bugs, but the owner/creator helped us right away!"
"it focuses first on the Japanese writing system the hiragana and later the katakana right now I'm still in the hiragana section I haven't went that far yet but once I get the hang of it, I will learn how to pronounce a few Japanese words overall this is a good software to teach you the basics of the Japanese language."
"I would have graded a 5 star, but I have just started the program. It appears to be easy to understand, and the method seems simplified for a beginner, which I am. I don't have any previous Japanese program to compare it to. So far so good."
good item i love it
Purchased for my eleven year old daughter.  It's easy for her to follow and understand.  Pleased with the purchase.
"Pros
- Introduces Hiragana and Katakana characters by teaching stroke order and pronunciation. The characters are introduced little by little with the help of a quiz, making them much easier to memorize as opposed to learning them all at once.
- Helpful cultural notes are dispersed throughout the software
- Concepts are introduced in an easy to understand, conversational way
- Audio recordings for all Japanese words and phrases

Cons
- Too much vocabulary is introduced at one time
- The vocabulary and concept quizzes are awful. There is no way to choose how many or which words are used in the quiz, it just quizzes you on everything in the chapter at random and indefinitely, making the quiz practically useless for chapters that have a lot of vocabulary, like chapter 28, which has 39 pages.
- There are no exercises whatsoever, only readings that do not require any user input. Because of this, in my opinion, coupled with the horrible quizzes, retention is rendered almost impossible.
- Some concepts are introduced seemingly at random. For example, the particle ""ni"" is introduced in chapter 20, but the particle ""de"" isn't introduced until chapter 35... The problem with this is that both particles are very similar in meaning and it would make a lot more sense to explain both of them at the same time. The result for me was that, for a long time, I incorrectly used ""ni"" in places where ""de"" belonged.
- Verb conjugation isn't explained at all. This to me is the worst part of the software. When the author introduces verbs, he introduces them in their ""-masu"" and ""-te"" forms instead of their dictionary forms. This makes it impossible to know what is actually happening to the verb. For example, when he introduces the verb ""iku"" (to go), he introduces it as ""ikimasu"" and ""itte"", providing no explanation for how ""ikimasu"" conjugates to ""itte"". In fact, the only way to know how this happens is to know that the dictionary form of ""ikimasu"" and ""itte"" is ""iku"", but he doesn't even mention it! There is also no mention of the difference between ""u"" verbs, ""ru"" verbs, and irregular verbs, leaving the user with the impression that the ""-masu"" and ""-te"" forms must simply be committed to memory.
- There are several typos throughout the software, including a typo in one of the Japanese examples.

Other thoughts:
I bought this software as a result of not being able to take the first two intro Japanese classes at my college. I figured that if I used this software, I could opt into the third course and continue from there. My reason for choosing Human Japanese was that I thought it would be much less overwhelming compared to using a textbook. Fortunately, it was. However, if I could go back in time I would definitely choose to use the Genki textbook instead. I was able to opt into the third class, but after going through the first Genki textbook and doing all the exercises, I can say confidently that the Genki textbook isn't that difficult to navigate and far more rewarding and informative."
"I was wanting to learn Japanese, not only to read and speak fluently, buy to be able to talk to myself without anyone knowing what i was saying. With this program, I am able to achieve my wish! This software is so down to earth and friendly, I am surprised I am not talking to an actual person.

I have had this software for a few months now, and when I get a break from my classes, I enjoy the time I spend learning this new language. There is one or two words placed wrongly in a sentence in English, but that is throughout the entire program, while its nothing to ponder on what they just said. You can also report it to Brak, and I am sure they will fix it.

How it works: At the beginning, there is a very mild and friendly introduction, that warms you up to what is coming later. Then, it gives you a tad but of history and few moments to tell you about the writing sysytem. Once that is over, it brings you through Hirigana, the first part, all the while showing you how to write the character and giving you a hint on how to write and how to remember it. Hirigana part 1 is over, now a few pages on the Geography of Japan. Now to Hirigana part 2! Once you have learned Hirigana, they launch you into an amazingly simple and easy introduction to Greetings and what to call things around the home, and explaining how verbs are used. There are 40 chapters, and I am only on 20, which is great, because I am at my own limit, as well as you can, either if you are slow or busy, or fast or in a rush. You need time for this though.

This software is cheap, as in the price, compared to Rosetta Stone. Rosetta Stone just starts flinging out words at you, where you have to figure out how to say it, and what it means, with no training under your belt. Not Human Japanese. I was about to buy a few books on how to speak and read Japanese, but i decided to go on a whim and purchase this software. I do not regret it, and it might have been the best 30 dollars i have ever spent......but i don't keep track. I am definitely going to buy Human Japanese Intermediate once I am done with this one. I am even hoping for them to do a Russian learning software.

Buy this if you are wanting a friendly, self paced software that you can have fun working through, but if you wished to be pushed through learning a language, and like to guess what your saying, go somewhere else. If this was 50 or 100 dollars, i would still buy it, and still say it is the best learning program i have ever used.

Remember as well, that this has fun match games and contest you can do with yourself or the computer, and beautiful recorded sound for the voices."
"I should've known for the price that I wasn't going to get much. It's great if you need something to help guide you - it's very teacher-ish in it's presentation, but it wasn't as immersive and interactive as I was hoping for. I get more feedback from my DS Japanese Coach game ^_^"
Well its good the human japanese language. Well it have its good and bad but i starting to learn something in japanese only by a little bit but yeah to me its worth it.
"Oh my god! I have never seen a language program that was so genuine as this! Whereas other language programs require you to just memorize grammar techniques, this one puts you in square one. It really shows that the developers have had years of experience with not just the language, but of the culture itself. I will be using this as I return to learning Japanese. I do recommend though to have a notebook on you when you're doing this, especially when learning about hiragana, katakana, and other words that you might see in print. This is for people who want to learn Japanese, but want to go at an easier pace."
Very detailed & easy to understand. It is a calm and relaxing experience that makes it that much more enjoyable.
"I've had this for several months and I really like it.  I feel like I am progressing well on my understanding of Japanese.  The only complaint that I have is the emphasis on learning hiragana over vocabulary, phrases, and actually speaking Japanese - but that may be only a personal preference.  If you want a complete understanding - then this is a great program.  I also really like the little games and tests for review."
really helps me understand which is great because im taking a japanese class and i don't always understand the teacher
My daughter got it and she likes it. She is learning Japanese and this will help her even more with it.
"I got this as a gift for my boyfriend. he's been using it for about 2 - 3 weeks now. he loves how easy it is. after his first lesson he was already reciting back what he had learned. you learn grammar, language & there are small sections about japanese culture which the boyfriend sees as a real treat. definitely a great purchase.

Also, my shipment arrived day after i ordered."
"Think of this program like a slightly interactive book. You're mostly reading, but when it comes time to look and learn words, you can click them to hear their pronunciation. Every Japanese sentence and word has voice dialogue for you to listen to if you choose.
I've been studying with this program for almost a month now and it has been extremely helpful. It really breaks things down and doesn't just tell you ""This means that."" but also explains ""(Why) This means that."" When learning about verbs and other particles such as 'wa', 'wo', 'ni', the programs takes great strides to explain how they attach to words, and how they are used in various situations and sentences.

The only problem I have with this program so far is that there isn't much it tries to do to help you remember anything. The few games it has at the end of some chapters are not very useful. You'll have to make your own methods or get some flashcards to memorize vocabulary. For learning the program is great, for exercising and remembering what you learn, not so much.

I'd still suggest this program overall for learning purposes. You can learn a lot, quickly, in detail, and then put what you learned to use in other activities."
"This really is a simple and informative way of getting yourself immersed in Japanese. The lessons are easy to understand and everything is explained in a friendly, easy to understand manner. All you really need to do is put your best effort into it and practice. If you really want to get an advantage then Japanese Hiragana & Katakana for Beginners: First Steps to Mastering the Japanese Writing System, is a MUST. Also available on Amazon"
"It is very easy to use and is useful for the casual learner of the Japanese language, especially good for the price. I have been to Japan several times since I bought the software."
"Beware! I bought this item new, and spoke with a representative from Human Japanese that told me that some of the cds had faulty activation codes that didn't work. I did receive in the mail a new disc and activation code that works on my computer. Customer service was excellent, and I received my new cd, and code in a week. If your activation code doesn't work, contact Human Japanese, so they can send you out a new code that works for you!"
"Currently I'm about halfway through the program, and I've found it to be well-paced and helpful in grinding in some basic concepts of Japanese grammar. I've been trying to self-teach since May, and although I've found a good system for learning kanji I still struggle to work up the motivation to learn grammar. I find the brevity of the chapters to be refreshing and easy to work through.

The text seems to be well researched. It doesn't make the mistake of telling you that ""anata"" can be used just like we use ""you,"" for example (one thing I didn't like about my old textbook; some of the advice and info was outdated).

Chapters are followed with vocabulary and concept reviews, allowing you to practice what you've learned. You can even choose to display the answers/questions in Japanese or English. The chapters are interspersed with cultural notes that explain how some things work in Japan. There are numerous example sentences, and you can click on them to hear them read aloud by native speakers.

To make it more accessible for beginners, everything (so far) is written using kana. I already know some basic kanji, so I would have liked the option to switch to kanji, but that's a minor gripe. The interface is simple and easy to use. I think I'll continue to use this and refer to it from time to time. This is a useful tool for absolute beginners."
"....That I bought it on my tablet too (digitally from the Play Store)! Know this: You will need some self-discipline to make use of this product. It doesn't hold your hand, it's just like a college class without the classmates. You will learn Hiragana and Katakana at the very least, if you write them out on paper (this is very effective for burning things into memory for long-term). I haven't gotten too far because I'm busy and forget about it but this is definitely worth the money, it's almost a steal!
Buy this product if you want to learn!
No shipping or quality issues, CD installed just fine."
"This title has a lot of really good information for those that are starting or just have started studying Japanese.
It does not get into Kanji, but it does go through Hiragana and Katakana, as well as vocab and grammar.
It also has a lot of historical and cultural information in it as well."
"I find this as a great product for someone who is first starting out in Japanese.  I have not toyed with the intermediate version yet, but plan to do so as soon as I finish this lengthy lesson.  I say lengthy because it seems to have everything I need.  I am not new to languages, but I am relatively new to japanese.  Buy it, it's worth it."
"I did enjoy the Rosetta Stone, I won't deny that, I had learned a lot from it.

Now this little beauty though, I learned a lot more.  Plus, it really feels like you have a one-on-one tutor that truly wants you to succeed.  They want you to learn the ins and outs, the why it is how it is, not just a handful of phrases.  You'll be able to put together sentences like never before in Japanese after going at it with this program.

However, if you can't handle a heavy dose of reading through the chapters than it wont' be for you."
My husband and I started the CD on our commute I work. The format is very easy to follow. Each course is approximately half an hour long so you don't get overwhelmed with information. We are thoroughly enjoying it and will continue through the entire disk set before you know it.
I hate giving these bad reviews but this software did not work whatsoever on my laptop. I had all of the requirements and even contacted the support but it didn't even start up. I'm still continuing to search out the problem but for now I have to leave it with a 1 star.
This product exceeded all expectations I set for it! Friendly writing and interesting information combine to form a cohesive learning experience. Love it!
"This program is amazing! For the first time, i actually understood what was being taught to me about a 2nd language. It broke the process down into a way i never thought of trying for other languages. I am being completely honest when i say, i learned more with this program in 1 month, then i did with 3 years of taking spanish. I recommend this to anyone looking into learning Japanese!"
I would highly recommend this product for any Japanese enthusiasts. It is appropriate for all age groups. It was bought as a gift and they loved it.
"This is an excellent product, professional in appearance, well written, but difficult to read for people with below-average eyesight. It needs to provide the capability to change the font size to the user's liking. Also, it would be nice to be able to change to a darker font as well.

Also, be advised that there is a free trial available; I don't see where it says what the free trial entails, but I found that the first eight of forty chapters are free if you download from their website. This is enough for you to get a good start and see how you like the product (and the language). Japanese is actually pretty easy - except for the writing!

Hajimemashite, Amazon shoppers..."
"This product is just amazing. I never left a review on amazon, but i had to for this wonderful product!!! The interface is pleasant and greatly done, and the colors are great! I love how the author program goes over the distinct differences of english and japanese, and then slowly works you into the ""nuts and bolts"" of japanese. I thought i would never learn a language because the concept of learning another languages grammar, spelling, punctuations,etc was just crazy. This program slowly introduces to the concepts of the language and then gives you a chance to read japanese characters. The japanese characters are click-able so you can listen to them. The author also demonstrates on how foreigners make a mistake on pronouncing words and he shows you how himself (He has an awesome voice). Then after a long exercise there is a break in between the program which talks about the culture etc with some nice pictures. I wish i knew about this program sooner! I started using this today and i can read about 20 japanese characters. This program is so simply yet complex! I love it so much and i recommend it to anyone who is afraid of learning a language, interested in learning it, or is interested in it! This is 100000x better than Rosetta stone! I swear to god! I feel 100% confident that i will learn japanese with this program. I would like to thank everyone who created this masterpiece of a product!!!! You surely deserve more!!! And the price is amazing! to be frank, this thing should be at least worth 50-100 dollars. I feel like i ripped them off somehow. :) Thanks again humanjapanese!!!!"
"I really like this book.  I have been teaching myself, for fun, and this is a great introductory work.  It starts right off with the Hirigana and as soon as it works through that, all the exercises are in Japanese.  It has a good pace and has breaks in the format to give you a rest and acquaint you with other information.  And it has great audio, to go with the lessons, so you can hear any word or phrase as often as you need.  Very good intro to Japanese."
Humorous and thorough. This product is a great companion to other programs/methods or as a foundation for understanding. Great Buy!
"I just started using this software, and find it one of the best ways to learn a language. It does not just give you a bunch of phrases to memorize. It teaches you the writing of the words as well as the pronunciation. Works for me I like it and the price was real good."
"It's hard for me to overstate the help I've gotten from this program in learning Japanese. I'm someone who has never done well with languages in a classroom setting. For some reason, my brain doesn't seem to jive well with the way most foreign language teachers teach. Nothing sinks in, concepts don't 'click', and  after I somehow pass the class, I forget everything.

That's what nearly happened when I took Japanese 100 in college last semester. The class would simply whizz by while I can honestly say I learned next to nothing. Finally, the week of finals, I decided I needed to do something to get up to speed so I'd pass. I used Human Japanese for a few days and learned more than I did during the whole semester. Not only that, but the program helped me to realize just how simple some of the concepts were.

While textbooks tend to describe things in technical-speak that would confuse my understanding even of my native language, Human Japanese does what the name suggests and what the developer promises: it explains Japanese in a personal, human way that does wonders for teaching the new language to someone. I can't tell you how many times I finished learning a new concept and was surprised at just how simple it had been. This program inspires confidence in your ability to learn Japanese. It doesn't take off and leave you in the dust anywhere, ever.

We use Rosetta Stone at school, and I literally hate the program. Never mind its price, Human Japanese is a far superior program for learning the basics of Japanese. The fact that it's much, much more affordable is a huge bonus. Keep in mind, Human Japanese has just released a follow-up program called Human Japanese Intermediate for people who have finished the original and want to delve further into the language. It has been released for iPad thus far, and will come to PC/Mac/iPhone/etc soon. I can't wait!"
I use Human Japanese to refresh myself. I have taken formal classes and even used Rosetta Stone. This is an inexpensive way to keep my Japanese language skills sharp.
"very basic/simple to use, nice chart that is printable to see progress.  good variety of sounds;.  highly recommended by our speech and language pathologist."
I have a special needs son at home and his teacher had started with him at school. I decided to purchase this product and continue at home. This way he is getting it in both places. He enjoys playing with it everyday. I would recomend this to someone I know.
"It's unfortunate that people / companies sell products that are geared for obsolete machines -- either this is a ploy to sell excess inventory, or the company isn't interested in updating their software.  Doesn't work at all on OSX 10 -- and you get some warning that says that it doesn't support Power PC (?).  Granted, at third read -- it does say that it supports OSX 9 and lower.  That said, I'm still frustrated that this isn't called out more prominently -- or better yet, this vendor updates the software."
It is an old version that won't play on our computers.  We tried 4 different computers.  This should be stated.
"Purchased this on the recommendation on my girl' speech therapist.  One daughter was using in school right after her speech class and the other two were geyting ready to start.  They all love playing with this & I'm not sure they realize they are learning too.

The only drawback is that you can only set-up two children with this version (I needed to set-up three).  My work around was to have one girl use the ""guest"" account as her own.  This does keep anyone else from even trying the game, but it keeps me from purchasing a second copy.

I would highly recommend this.  I will be purchasing Step 2 very soon."
good for learning all aspects of microsoft word
"Great book, tons if information!"
CD not needed for this class-all info was provided online by instructor
great
Works for me n like it much
"It's a wonderful text book n it's very easy to follow, I recommend this Word 2013 to everyone who would like to teach yourself in Microsoft Word. I love it n I will keep it as my ref book."
"Book was in good condition, but as with the first book, there was no CD...It was of no use to me without the CD"
"This version is not backwards compatible.
Windows seven and up ONLY. Unless you own all very recent PCs you won't get to use your five PC license."
"Don't buy this product...at least until Microsoft does some work on it and puts color back into the programs. As it stands now you can only have white, light grey or darker gray and it is horrible. It strains the eyes, you can't find any distinction on the scroll bars, you can't see the corner of the screen where you can shrink or x out of the program. It's abysmal. Outlook is just drab, hard to navigate and depressing! Word and Publisher are worse. I'm going to go back to office 2010...I honestly don't know what they were thinking. Don't take my word for it, Look up ""putting color into Microsoft office 2013"" on the web...everyone is complaining!!!!"
"I really like the subscription model offered here.  All the main components of Office 2013 are available to 1) load on up to 5 PCs (even Office 2011 for Mac too), 2) On demand access to software anytime/anywhere 3) easy online management of software
Other great new options:
  - Skydrive integration (plus 20 more GB free)
  - Touch enabled
  - Auto update to any new version (with active subscription)
  - Skype minutes each month
  - Very fast and responsive
  - Features are easier to find with Ribbon interface
  - Social features (Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, etc.) if you choose to add them
Definitely check this version out, goes great with a new PC.  If unsure, select the ""Try"" option on office.microsoft.com and then come back to pick it up!"
"Mister Quensway, 'recognise' is the British spelling of 'recognize'. If you were a Briton you would not want to be corrected. But there should be an option to choose British or American spelling."
"It has been 10 years since the new versions of office documents (docx, pptx etc) were introduced.  For better or worse, Ribbon interface is here to stay.  Is there something new that Microsoft can bring to the table?

I write as a sole proprietor who has been using Office 365 Enterprise for half a year.  I installed Office 2013 RTM (i.e. final version) about a month earlier than the official release in late January 2013.  My review will answer 1) why and who should upgrade to Office 2013 and 2) which version (Home & Business, Pro, Office 365 Home Premium, Small Business or Enterprise) to choose.

For Q1 (who should and why upgrade), my short answer is: upgrade if you are: a) using a touch computer; b) you own several computers and use all of them to edit the same documents; c) you are running on a slow computer and wants some extra speed.  Otherwise there is no need to upgrade from 2007/2010.  2003 users will have to decide whether they want to make the switch to Ribbon.

1A - Using a touch computer
I own a Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro, a Windows 8 Pro tablet.  Office 2013 automatically recognizes the touchscreen and increases the spacing between icons for me.  Frankly the increased spacing is not much use on my 11.6 inch display as mis-clicks are still frequent.  I still resort to the built-in pen for clicking the small icons (Save, undo etc).

More importantly, the new version supports gestures such as pinch to zoom and flicking the screen to scroll.  This, together with Windows 8 Pro, make touch experience almost bearable on a PC.

Of course, to truly take advantage of Office 2013's touch function, you also need Windows 8.  The on-screen keyboard in Windows 8 is simply better than the one in Windows 7.  The most important improvement is the maximize icon next to the X button of the keyboard.  Press it, and the keyboard becomes ""one with the taskbar"".  The app will not occupy the space beneath the keyboard and make itself inaccessible (because the keyboard floats above it).

Word now supports a Reader mode, which is HUGELY useful and makes me want to convert all my ePub to word documents.  The idea is simple: Word reflows the text to single column/double columns while maintaining certain formatting like italic, fonts, highlighting etc and discarding others (tabs, line spacing for example).  This is similar to what we experience from other eReaders (Amazon Kindle, ePub readers etc).  The great thing about reading document in Word 2013 is that you can save your annotation directly on the file - there is no need to worry about syncing annotation.  Contrast this to reading ePub - each software saves its own annotation file that cannot be easily read by another software.

1B - Multiple computers, one document
Having multiple computers is both a blessing and a curse.  Nothing beats turning off your office computer and take an early leave, knowing that whatever you failed to complete can be finished at home.  However it is a nightmare to learn that the document (or the newest version of it) is not available when you arrive at home.

There are many ways to transfer files from office to home, from the tedious (USB, manual or software assisted) to the care-free (dropbox automatic sync).  Your organization may or may not allow USB drives (for good reasons).  Dropbox requires administrative privilege which 99% of the working force do not have.  With Office 2013 you have a third option - save to your own Skydrive.  If you purchase the non-subscription version, you get 7GB space of Skydrive, Office 365 Home Premium gives you 27GB.  For the business version, storage depends on the base subscription and add-on plans.  Skydrive is like a USB stick that connects to your computer through the Internet.  You can create folders, save files, read files, delete files just as you would on a USB stick.  The difference is that it is always available as long as you have connection to the Internet.

To save to Skydrive, you must first have a Microsoft Live account.  If you have a Hotmail/outlook.com email account, you already have one.  You can also register a Live Account with any email you own (gmail Yahoo university mail).  You then login to this Live account from within Office, you only need to do it once for each computer, and you can do it in Excel/Word/etc.  After you have logged in, you can Save the document to Skydrive by pressing the icon linking to your skydrive, and you will be prompted with your Skydrive's folder structure - just as what you would see if you were to save on C drive.  To open a file, choose Open, then press the icon to your skydrive, and viola - your file is there.  A little icon called Office Upload Assistant on bottom right area next to the clock (the notification area) tells you whether all documents have been uploaded.

I also like the fact that opening Word 2013 shows you a Welcome screen with built-in templates AND YOUR OWN TEMPLATES (provided they are saved in Skydrive/locally).  No longer do you need to go through layers of folders before finding the template for Invoice etc.  You can also ""pin"" your favorite templates so that they are one-click away from being created.  You can of course still create new documents from templates the way you would in 2007/2010.

1C - Performance
Performance is BIG thing nowadays.  Finally Microsoft saw the need to reduce the footprints of its software and make them more suitable for the ""average"" machines.  It used to be the case that business machines are evaluated by how many Internet Explorer and Microsoft Word can be opened simultaneously while running on Windows Vista!

Having used the RAM-eating Office 2007 and the atrociously slow Office 2010, Office 2013 breathes new life to my 4 years old Dell Latitude E4200 (running on an ultra-low voltage dual-core Penryn processor).  I used to uncheck Outlook when I re-installed Office 2007/2010 because they start up painfully slowly.  The speed of Outlook 2013 is almost tolerable (about 7 seconds).  Outlook 2013 also does not cause my notebook to stutter.

The re-sizing on Word has also been improved.  It no longer draws accurate snapshots of the document as you zoom.  Instead it ""blurs"" the document as you zoom, and after you have settled on the zoom level, it draws a final, accurate snapshot.  It may not seem much, but coming from a computer-engineering background, I suspect this reduces CPU workload (and thus energy use) significantly.

Saving, opening, and switching between Ribbon tabs now feel instant even on my crappy 4 years-old laptop.  On my new Samsung tablet (sporting the newest Intel processor), starting Word is instant and outlook takes a mere 2 seconds to show.  The whole experience is very much like using an iPad, where every app loads instantaneously.

New features
I can only comment on Word, Onenote and Outlook 2013, which I use daily.  I will let my more knowledgeable fellow reviewers comment on the rest.

Word 2013
New features include the reader mode, touch-icons, touch gestures (mentioned above).

Track Changes is now infinitely more useful as it shows comments like a conversation.  The new Office Store allows you to install third-party apps (such as Merriam-Webster Dictionaries) to increase functionality.  You no longer need to ""hunt"" for plug-ins as you would for all previous versions.

You may or may not need the add pictures from an online location function.  The ability to embed YouTube video is also of dubious use - I prefer saving the youtube video offline, convert it and send it as an attachment to the word document.  This way my client won't ring me at 2am complaining they cannot view the clip (whether it is due to their connection to YouTube or some technical problem I do not care to solve), but this is just me.

The much-touted PDF manipulation is trash.  It seems that whatever PDF file I open using Word 2013, formatting is heavily messed up.  Apparently Microsoft tries to convert PDF to DOCX first before you can do any meaningful operation.  You are better off with a software that treats PDF as a PDF, such as the cheap but excellent PDF-XCHANGE software suites.

OneNote 2013
I could not be bothered to compare the feature sets between OneNote MX (free with Windows 8) and OneNote 2013.  It suffices to note that MX has fewer features but a more touch-centric control.
OneNote still does not get the degree of formatting control like Word.  You cannot make multi-layered lists or format text (and change formatting) using an umbrella category (like the Body, Heading 1, Heading 2).  Still, I enjoy jotting notes with OneNote much more than with Word.  Lists just indent to the proper place EVERY SINGLE TIME and there is no need to deal with page breaks.

I cannot think of any new features that are worth mentioning.  Onenote 2010 already had some sort of integration with the predecessor to Skydrive (called Live Drive).  The auto-correct still does not correct Recognise to Recognize etc (as Word 2013) does.  You can still add Online picture as you do in Word 2013.  There is also a new helper software that sits on the Taskbar and help you get screen capture quicker.  I always turn off the helper software because it adds unnecessary complexity to my taskbar.

Outlook 2013
Microsoft has not gone enough to change Outlook 2013.  Just as 2007/2010, it is extremely difficult to change account settings such as whether to download headers only or full text (with or without attachments).  The data file (OST or PST) still reside in the elusive place of C:\User\(user name)\AppData instead of your own ""My Document"" folder.  Sure you will forget to back that up as you re-install windows?  You also cannot see all emails using an ""Unified Inbox"" as you would with a 2-year old android phone/iPhone without using a script (search unified inbox vba if you really want to know)

Outlook has always struggled to find a proper interface.  I still recall using Outlook 2000 and being greeted with a Today's screen which shows some of my unread emails and upcoming appointments in extremely small fonts.  Outlook 2013 is better, when you start it shows you the Inbox, and you can quickly switch to appointments/contacts from the bottom left huge icons.

One new feature is integration with Facebook/other social networks.  The idea is to merge your contacts with Facebook's contacts.  I only connected about 20% of my friends because Outlook doesn't know Charles Jeremy Moore in outlook is really Charles Moore on Facebook.  You can of course manually link them as you could in the People app in Windows 8, but I cannot be bothered.

Assuming you have linked facebook contacts with Outlook, you can see a snapshot of your friend's profile while reading his email.  Useful?  I doubt it.  It is not often the case that your business associates will write something you absolutely must know business-wise (gossiping is another matter).  If there is some blogs/feeds you must read, the recommended course is to setup an RSS feed and read it regularly.  Stumbling upon someone's relationship status only distracts you from the current work.

It may or may not be a new feature, but pinning Outlook 2013 to your taskbar allows you to create tasks/appointments quickly.  Right-click the icon (not left click) and you will be greeted with a short-cut for New Appointment/Email/Contact/Task/Meeting.  What is best is that using any of the above will not launch Outlook 2013, not the whole program at least.  It is extremely handy for adding new appointments etc when you are talking on phone.  The ability to quickly add appointment from Outlook 2013 is one of the reasons I ditched Google in favour of my Office 365 Exchange account for storing calendars and contacts.  (note: Outlook 2013 cannot sync with Gmail's Exchange ActiveSync as of now, Outlook blames Google for not having the newest Exchange version).
WARNING: do not use the New Email function from the right click menu.  After you have typed your email, it is stored at the Outbox but NOT send out.  You have to launch Outlook to send it.  I cannot understand what Microsoft is thinking...

2 - Comparison
I have been using Office 365 to host my business email address and website for half a year, so I am familiar with the subscription model.

Feature-wise Office Pro and Office 365 is the same (but note the difference in Skydrive storage).  Simple math tells us that the price for Office Pro equates 4 years of Office 365.  The catch for purchasing Office Pro is that you are limited to 1 PC while Office 365 covers 5.  If you own more than 1 device, Office 365 is a no-brainer, or so it seems.

The reason why I gave Office Pro 5 stars while Office 365 Home Premium 3 stars is solely based on Price alone.  If you are a sole proprietor/small business, you are better-off with the Office 365 business plans (as I am subscribing).  If you are a Home User, as the name Home Premium suggest, I make the following assumptions: 1) your company pays for the office licence in your work computer(s) and 2) you do not have more than 1 home computer that needs Office.  Under this assumption the 5 PC advantage practically falls away.  The remaining question is whether you will upgrade in 4 years and whether the extra storage matters.

4 years is a bit longer than 1 product cycle (see 2003 - 2007-2010-2013).  If you will buy/subscribe Office 2016/2017 (if there is one) when it is released, then subscribing to Home Premium will present better value.  If you will skip one product cycle (i.e. skipping 2016/2017 and purchase 2020/2021), then Office Pro is better value.  I think most home users can afford to lag behind more than 1 product cycle.  New products are not always better, often the new features are useless to a home user and the new interface just spells frustration.

I think Office 365 HP is only appeal to users who match every criterion below:
1) You need Outlook/Access/Publisher
2) You have more than 1 computer
3) You plan to receive the next Office as it becomes available
4) You are not benefitted by Office 365 business versions

Regarding 1) above, most home users need Word/Excel/Powerpoint only, and their needs are well served by the cheaper Home versions.  Please note that if you do not use Outlook now, you probably won't need it in the future.  It is an overkill for checking gmail etc.  Access and Publisher require you to sit down and learn, possibly taking 1 month each before you fully appreciate their use and advantage over Excel/Word.  There is no point in going for Office Pro or Office HP just to get all software and be ""future-proof"" if Office Home Student/Home Business is good enough.

If you are willing to pay so much for the extra software (Outlook/Publisher/Access), but doesn't receive a free licence from your company, chances are that you work at a SMB.  SMBs stand to benefit A LOT from Office 365 business (see below), and even though you may not implement all the features, Office 365 business is still worth considering.

Office 365 Home Premium is expensive compared with Office 365 Enterprise.  At $20/Month Office 365 Enterprise gives you all Office software, your own exchange email account, Sharepoint and Lync (basic) servers.  The website shows Office Professional Plus 2010, but you can download Office 2013 RTM from TechNet and use your Office 365 login name to get the software running.  That was how I got Office 2013 a month earlier than the general public.

I wish only to add that regardless of whether you use Office 365 HP or Office 365 Ent, Office Web App is trash.  The idea of being able to edit document from a web-browser (running on an iPad maybe) is attractive, but unrealistic.  The reasons are: 1) Web App only supports DocX etc formats, but not the old formats; 2) more importantly, formatting is often MESSED UP when you use Web App.

More coming: the benefit of having your own exchange account and more importantly sharepoint server (in the coming week) and why it is much better value to sole proprietor/small business."

"I thought I would upgrade my Office 2007 package to Office 365 Home since Office 2007 is at end of life. Big mistake.

I downloaded Office 365 on a brand new computer from Dell. Went through all updates to Windows 10 to make sure I was at the latest and greatest release. Mapped network drives and verified I could access files on the NAS (Network Attached Server) I have on our home network. So far so good. This is when I installed Office 365; note that Office 2007 not yet installed on this machine. I have 3 other PCs, one of which is an old laptop (7 years) which this new pc is to replace. All of the others PCs are running Windows 10, Office 2007 and dta stored on the NAS working just fine.

Office 365 installs fine and I of course check for and install all Office updates. I am able to open files from the NAS but every time I do so I get the protected view warning that documents downloaded from the internet could be unsafe. Not wanting to have to click enable for that warning every time for the rest of my life for any file that I open from the NAS I went to make my NAS location a Trusted Location. But when I follow Microsoft's instructions on how to do that I get the ""cannot do this for security reasons error"". Sigh - Microsoft has now made it irritating and unnecessarily complex to use my home network. SO I look on the web and find this is not an uncommon problem but the homebrew solutions out there involve editing the registry or other equally arcane solutions involving trusting someone on the web's incantation to fix it - ""really it will, just trust me"".

Next step - call Microsoft Tech support. I'll bet you can guess how that turned out. I quickly exhaust the minuscule competence of the first level support, but to be fair all I really expected was for them to be able to send me to someone who had competence beyond check the power cord and on button.  So I get a scheduled time for Tier 2 to call me back . Fair enough. I get a call from Tier 2 asking me what is the issue. So all the work I spent explaining the issue to the first help person was wasted. This would prove to be a recurring theme since I would have to start all over with each new person. So this expert asked to take remote control of my machine. OK. Then they turned off protected view entirely, which meant I would be eliminating security for the entire internet. Not what I needed. So took the time to step her through the process of Trusted Locations and explained I just wanted to trust my NAS, not the entire hacking community. She was able to see the error message, but had no idea how to troubleshoot this. Fair enough - I expected that she would pass me on to the next tier and to a technician  who specialized in the area. But  instead she asked to take a few minutes to confer with her team. OK - I appreciate someone who wants to figure things out and is willing to consult with teammates. A little while later she comes back and wants to try everything but this time as an administrator. Good idea but doesn't work. Then here is the stunner - she asked if I could call an IT person. I thought she meant a Microsoft help IT person at first, but no she meant did I have an IT person somewhere in the home. I then patiently explained that I was the person who set up my PCs and Home network and that It all worked just fine on the other machines. She basically said I am out of luck then.  What?!?!  SO I stated I would need to get a refund. That of course prompted her to say she would transfer me over to the commercial side, could I please hold while she transferred me. Now we're getting somewhere! Nope!  I talked with the commercial side operator, explain yet again the issue and she asks for my domain email account. I do not have one. She says they cannot help a home user. She gives me another phone number. I call it and give them my case number again and explain the issue again only to find out I am back at the basic help desk again. But the help desk person says the even though this is an issue found in Office, it is likely a Windows function causing the problem. He sends me on to the Windows tech support. After waiting on hold for 37 minutes and 17 seconds I finally arrive at a human being, She asks me to please tell her what the issue is. Since I have had plenty of practice by now I can recite it quickly and subconsciously. She states that she would have to escalate the problem so would I please hold, but then we are disconnected and I never receive a call back. I call back to tech support, they say it was unacceptable that I should have to wait so long. I agreed. But they would have to escalate the issue to a higher tier and would it be okay if they called back in 30 minutes to an hour. After verifying they had the correct phone number I thanked him for his time and hung up. And that's the last I heard from Microsoft. Several hours wasted...

So then in about 30 minutes I was able to install Office 2007 on the new machine, check and install all the latest updates,  map the network drives, and verify the proper functioning without even having to set trusted locations - and - bonus - was able to request a refund from Amazon, have it approved, and UPS scheduled to pick up this defective product and send it back.

Kudos to Amazon for being professional to work with and quick to respond. I am so relieved I bought through Amazon instead of Microsoft.
Microsoft - you have a long, long way to go.

So my advice is to avoid upgrading to Office 365 unless you have a compelling need and do not have a home network attached storage."
I like office 365 so when the subscription cards go on sale I pick them up to extend my subscription
Microsoft products are always a favorite of mine!!
I did not realize that this product is cloud-based and requires an annual fee to use. I discarded it.
It's helpful
"I bought this to be able to use a custom domain and have it send to my new Outlook online account. This used to be a feature, and there are even existing links in the web interface pointing you to be able to do this, but they just point to the online Outlook app now.

Now you have to get: Office 365 Small Business, Office 365 Small Business Premium, Office 365 Enterprise (E1 Plan), Office 365 Midsize Business and Office 365 Enterprise (E3 Plan).

They previously removed this functionality from Outlook premium which is why I bought the Office 365 Home. I am not being upsold to get the functionality I was supposed to get. I will be looking for a non-Microsoft solution."
GREAT AS ALWAYS  LOVE IT
"Bought this product because I thought that I was getting a really great deal on Cyber Monday. the product says it is for 5 users, but when received it is for one user only. Scam!!"
"When you try to install it you get the following message:  ""This product is not intended for your identified region. Please contact support for help.""  WHAT EVER YOU DO DO NOT CONTACT SUPPORT FOR HELP-IT WILL CAUSE YOUR COMPUTER TO HAVE PROBLEMS. This was a rip off!!!  I paid $106.41 and was never able to use it.  Do not buy anything sold by Triplenet Pricing INC  I would not even give it one star but if you don't you can't review it."
"Excel:
Does not allow you to copy and paste sometimes. I later found out it's related to having many Excels open.
Clicking the lower edge of a cell will navigate to the end of the sheet.
Does not allow you to paste into visible cells only, despite having this setting selected.
Shortening long numbers by default
Does not save, unable to edit a cell. Freezes.
Constantly freezes, unable to copy, close, or open anything. The only way out is to close all the windows and restart, or end task.
Mangles special characters and eff me over on more than a few occasions. Why would the default encoding be Western instead of UTF-8??
Returning false positive in Conditional Formating when highlighting duplicate values.
Opening a new window will minimize it (the new window)

Outlook:
Minimizes a newly opened window.
Folder pane disappears for no reason, unable to go back to Mail from Calendar.
Cannot search for emails using part of the senders domain, would have to provide the entire domain.
It updated and then it says ""this app can't run on your pc""
Run indexing in the middle of the day, preventing search results to fully return.
Crashes constantly."
Installed easily but now I want to add it to another PC and can't find the product code so can't use it.
Just what I needed at an affordable price
easy to install
"Outlook 365 looks horrible on Windows! Color choices are terrible and they cannot be customized. There's a few predefined schemes all of which are terrible. Doesn't feel like an upgrade. Mac version is slightly better. Had to go back to Office 2010 on PC. After playing with the Office 365 I realized there's nothing in it that 2010 doesn't have. The only thing 2010 ""lacks"" is a yearly subscription fee. Office 2010 Windows and Office 2011 Mac were the last ""good office"" that still work everywhere."
Excellent price
This was a scam do not purchase it.
"I have tried several times to install this product.  When I try to install, I get an error code (MSO34017-4) and instructions to call a support number.  They tell me that fixing this error will cost me $249.95.  They will do it remotely.  The call center was definitely overseas and the connection was poor.  Do not make the same mistake that I did."
"Tried loading it.  Said I had an error, call this number.  Number was not Microsoft but a third party interested in selling me protection for my computer. Not cool."
Didn't work with more than one computer.  had to purchase elsewhere.
Product was easy to load and worked well!
